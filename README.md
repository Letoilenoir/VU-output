# Audio Frequency Analyzer

This script is a simple tool to visualize the frequency spectrum of an audio file in the WAV format. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter, a standard Python library for creating GUI applications. The script allows users to select a WAV file from their computer, and then plots the frequency spectrum of the audio channel using matplotlib.

## How to Use:

1. **Run the Script**: Execute the script in a Python environment. This will open a window with a "Browse" button and a "Plot Frequency Spectrum" button.

2. **Browse for Audio File**: Click the "Browse" button to select a WAV audio file from your computer. Only WAV files can be selected.

3. **Plot Frequency Spectrum**: After selecting the audio file, click the "Plot Frequency Spectrum" button. This will generate a plot showing the frequency spectrum of the audio channel.

## Understanding the Plot:

- **X-axis (Frequency)**: Represents the frequency of the audio signal in Hertz (Hz). The plot displays frequencies from 0 Hz to half of the sampling rate (Nyquist frequency).

- **Y-axis (Amplitude)**: Represents the amplitude or strength of each frequency component in the audio signal.

- **Plot Interpretation**: Peaks in the plot indicate prominent frequencies present in the audio file. Higher peaks correspond to louder or more significant frequencies.

## Requirements:

- **Python**: The script requires Python installed on your computer.
- **Libraries**: The following Python libraries are required:
  - `tkinter`: For creating the GUI.
  - `numpy`: For numerical computations.
  - `matplotlib`: For plotting the frequency spectrum.
  - `scipy`: For reading the WAV file and computing the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).

## Notes:

- **WAV File Format**: The script supports only WAV audio files. Other formats are not compatible.
- **Sampling Rate**: The frequency spectrum is plotted based on the sampling rate of the audio file.
- **Channel Handling**: If the audio file has multiple channels, the script will take the average of all channels to plot the frequency spectrum.
